# Project "Springfield"
This repository contains [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (k8s) manifests, documentation, etc. about our internal GPU-powered compute cluster.

The primary intent behind the repository is to maintain a version controlled documentation about our cluster setup. Currently the steps needed to create the cluster involves manually applying manifests, but we intend to experiment with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) in the future.

## Why Springfield?
We needed a naming scheme our cluster nodes, and we decided to use names of characters from [_The Simpsonsâ„¢_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons). Therefore it felt obvious to name the cluster itself after the town where all the action takes place.
