# Project "Springfield"

_Springfield_ is the codename for the GPU cluster owned and operated by the
[UiT Machine Learning Group](https://machine-learning.uit.no). Currently the
cluster consists of four physical nodes, three of which are GPU servers.
The nodes are joined together as a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster.

## Getting access

Access to the cluster is strictly controlled and only available to researchers
and students directly associated with the research group. Detailed instructions
are given in the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide.
